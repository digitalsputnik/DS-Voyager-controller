## In this file is list of features that we would like to implement.

## GOALS!
1. [Project handling](https://github.com/digitalsputnik/DS-Voyager-controller/milestone/14) - Change existing setup without the need to upload all the frames all over again + autosave.
1. [Animation control](https://github.com/digitalsputnik/DS-Voyager-controller/milestone/13) - fade in/fade-out (preliminary timeline implentation)
1. FX settings and CW Sliders: value range vs outcome proportions + for ex Possibility for lower Intesity than 1%
1. DigitalSputnik.NET - Overview the library for open sourcing, from v2.6 Voyager Controller will use this library.
1. DMX controller software - sACN/ArtNet input to Voyager stream
1. Easy music/rhythm sync: stream from some other app? (in addition to ex: After Effects) - or some Play/Pause/Stop sync possibility
1. Communication protocol (RUDP) + format - Document the requirements and communication scheme. Use protocol that would be best suited (for instance current JSON parsing might take too long for parsing). Use some RUDP implementation, either our own or open sourced (i.e. https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib).
1. Bluetooth library - Something to put on sale on Unity Asset Store
1. Embedded render engine - Write embedded software using lower level language (i.e. C, C++, Rust, Arduino) to have a better control over device and to expand it to other microcontrollers.
1. Tag system apply - tags for other devices to sort lamps
1. Voyager Controller UX ja Monet UX using DigitalSputnik.NET back-end
1. Monet release/multicontroller support (playback + ITSHX)
1. Matrix mapping
1. Underwater usage/serial control (playback + ITSHX) - [prototype is available with ITSHX control](https://github.com/digitalsputnik/DS-Voyager-controller/releases/tag/v2.6.1)
1. NDI integration to Voyager Controller for virtual studios
1. Smart home integration (i.e. Google home voice control)
1. Dropbox/Gdrive integration for project sharing - included in [Project handling](https://github.com/digitalsputnik/DS-Voyager-controller/milestone/14)
